I began by using the parameters that were used in the lecture notes. This model performed very
poorly with a loss of 3.4935 (using cross-entropy loss function) and an accuracy of only 5.39%
( which is only a little over twice as good as guessing randomly). Another thing I noticed
was that it only improved marginally after the first epoch (going from 5.1 to 3.59 loss) 
and the loss only decreased by 0.09 over the next 9 epochs.
